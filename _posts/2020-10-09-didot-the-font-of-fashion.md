The Didot typefaces were first created in 1984 by the Didot family. Despite being interjected into the world of typography almost 250 years ago; Didot remains a significant icon in the fashion industry. Used by substantial brands such as Harper’s Bazaar, Giorgio Armani, Zara, Louis Vuitton - and lest we forget one of the biggest names in the world of fashion; Vogue Magazine. Used by colossal companies such as these, it is no surprise that the Didot typeface is often associated with style and elegance - but how did it come to be used by these giants in the first place?

When Didot was first created it was something unique that hadn’t been seen in the typography industry before. This is mainly due to the extreme contrasts between the slender, hairline serifs against the bolder body of the letters. This is mostly recognisable within the capital letters featured such as A,M,N and U where there are multiple vertical strokes.

It is for this reason that Didot is often referred to as a neoclassical font as serifs are known to be vintage however the sleekness of the serifs gives the type a modernistic feel. The use of high contrast allowed the typeface to be instantly recognisable from others; although this quality has now been adapted into many other fonts used within the fashion world.

However, while the contrast used within the typeface seems to be it’s greatest strength, it could also be considered its greatest downfall. The thin strokes have a ‘dazzle’ effect on readers of the typeface. This means that when the didot typeface is presented in a small size, the bold verticals are competing with the slimmer segments of each letter; causing the text to be somewhat illegible. Henceforth, Didot is rarely used as a body text and is much better suited to large headlines and titles. To tackle this issue, variations of the Didot typeface were created with less contrast in order to adapt the font for body text use.
